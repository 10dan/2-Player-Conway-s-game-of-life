This pattern database contains 3827 pattern files for several hundred patterns in Conway's Game of Life and related cellular automata. All small patterns are provided in the RLE file format, and many patterns are provided in the plaintext .cells file format as well. The file formats are:

RLE (.rle): A short way on encoding patterns, but not very human-readable. See www.conwaylife.com/wiki/RLE
Plaintext (.cells): A human-readable, but not very efficient, file format that is primarily useful for small patterns. Dead cells are stored as "." and live cells are stored as "O". See www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Plaintext
